_Last updated: 2025-10-28_

Thank you for using **All Receipt** (“we”, “us”, “our”). This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application uses your device’s camera, what data is collected (or not), how that data is processed, stored and retained, and what your choices are.

## 1. Camera Usage  
Our app requests access to your device’s camera (permission: `android.permission.CAMERA`) in order to allow you to **take a picture of a receipt**. The receipt image is needed so that you can choose to use an AI model (either on-device or via a remote service) to process and extract information from the receipt (such as merchant name, date, amount, items, etc.).

## 2. What Data Is Collected  
- The app itself **does not collect any personal data** automatically.  
- The only image captured is the receipt image you actively take via the camera inside the app.  
- The image is not stored or uploaded automatically by us—**you control whether the image is sent to an AI model**.  
- If you choose to use a remote AI service (via the API you select) the image will be sent via network to that service. Otherwise, if you choose the local on-device model, the image stays on your device.

## 3. How Data Is Used and Shared  
- The receipt image is used to perform receipt recognition (identifying merchant, date, total, line-items etc).  
- If you select a remote AI service, the image will be transmitted over the network to that service for processing.  
  * We do not share the image with any other third parties beyond the AI service you have selected.  
- If you choose the local on-device model, the image is processed entirely on your device, and **no network transmission occurs**.  
- You remain in control of which AI processing route (local vs remote) you choose; we do not mandate or force data sharing.

## 4. Retention and Deletion Practices  
- On your device: The receipt image you capture remains stored in your phone’s storage (within the app’s folder or as configured by you).  
- On the AI backend (remote service): Whether or not the image is retained depends on the remote API/service you choose.  
  * We encourage you to review the remote service’s privacy policy and data retention/deletion policy.  
- You may delete the image at any time via the app’s interface (or by deleting the file from your device).  
- If you discontinue using the remote service, you should delete the image from your device and optionally on the service side (in accordance with that service’s policy).

## 5. Your Choices and Controls  
- You can withdraw camera permission at any time in your device settings; if you do, the feature to take receipt pictures will no longer function.  
- You can choose whether to use a remote AI service or the on-device model.  
- You may delete any captured receipt image from your device at any time.  
- If you choose a remote AI service, you should review, and if necessary request, the deletion of your receipt image from their system (per their policy).

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy  
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will change when we do. We encourage you to review it each time you use an updated version of the app.
